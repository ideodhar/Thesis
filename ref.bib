abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this study is to review the literature on the relationship between information and communication technology (ICT), small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and poverty reduction. The first dimension looks at the role of ICT use in SMEs. The second dimension investigates how the use of ICTs by SMEs can enable poverty reduction. A systematic literature review methodology is rigorously employed to analyse the literature in order to reach conclusions. In addition, this study meticulously captures some important gaps in the current literature and proposes novel future directions of research. This paper concludes that ICTs can be used as a tool for driving socio-economic development, such as poverty reduction, by SMEs. A systematic literature review on the interaction between ICT use by SMEs and poverty reduction, as conducted in this study, has not been undertaken before. This study will benefit scholars, business owners, government and non-government agencies that focus on the development of the SME sector to understand the role of ICT use in SMEs to enable development and poverty reduction.

On the basis of sampling experiments which compare the performance of quasi t-statistics, we find that one estimator, based on the jackknife, performs better in small samples than the rest. We also examine the finite-sample properties of using modified critical values based on Edgeworth approximations, as proposed by Rothenberg (1984). In addition, we compare the power of several tests for heteroskedasticity, and find that it may be wise to employ the jackknife heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix even in the absence of detected heteroskedasticity.}

 abstract = {In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM), however, are consistent even in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications that use a HCCM appear to rely on the asymptotic version known as HC0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that HC0 often results in incorrect inferences when N ≤ 250, while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of the HCCM, and especially a version known as HC3, work well even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a HCCM whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2) the decision to use HCCM-based tests should not be determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and (3) when N ≤ 250, the HCCM known as HC3 should be used. Sinceman HC3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors of statistical software to add this estimator to their programs.},
