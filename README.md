# Assessing the Poverty Alleviating Effects of MSMEs in India

This repository contains the materials, scripts, and outputs for my undergraduate thesis, which investigates the relationship between Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and poverty alleviation in India. Through rigorous analysis, the research aims to quantify the socioeconomic impact of MSME growth on reducing poverty across states.

## Repository Structure

- **R Scripts**:
  - `asi_clean.R`: Data cleaning and preparation for Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) data.
  - `asi_heat.R`, `heatmap.R`: Scripts for generating heatmaps visualizing MSME and poverty data.
  - `msme_count.R`, `poverty_calc.R`: R scripts for MSME and poverty analysis.
  - `results.R`: Econometric modeling script.
- **LaTeX Files**:
  - `dissertation_bsc.tex`, `sl_bsc_thesis.tex`: Thesis documentation in LaTeX format.
  - `ref.bib`: Bibliography file for references.
- **Data Files**:
  - `finance_sheet.txt`, `key_sheet.txt`: Processed data files used in the analysis.
- **Outputs**:
  - `msme_plot.pdf`, `poverty_plot.pdf`: Visualizations generated from the analysis.

## Key Highlights

- **Research Focus**: 
  - Explores the role of MSMEs in poverty reduction with a focus on state-level variations.
  - Differentiates the impacts of Micro, Small, and Medium enterprises.
- **Datasets Used**:
  - Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for MSME counts.
  - CMIEâ€™s CPHS data for poverty estimates.
- **Methodologies**:
  - Econometric modeling using fixed-effects regression.
  - Data visualizations to depict MSME growth and poverty trends.

## Research Questions

1. What is the effect of MSMEs on poverty headcount ratios in India?
2. How do different enterprise categories (Micro, Small, Medium) influence this effect?
3. Do grouped categories of MSMEs (e.g., Small-Medium vs. Micro-Small) show distinct patterns?

## Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: R (for data analysis), LaTeX (for thesis documentation).
- **Statistical Methods**: Fixed-effects models with robust standard errors, diagnostic tests for multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity.

## Results

- MSMEs, particularly Small and Medium enterprises, have a significant poverty-alleviating effect.
- Micro enterprises exhibit a more nuanced and less significant relationship with poverty.

## Future Scope

- Extend analysis to include service-sector MSMEs.
- Use multidimensional poverty metrics for a holistic assessment.
- Study the link between MSME productivity, wages, and poverty reduction.
